🚀 **Step right up, step right up!** Welcome to the future of mathematics, right at your fingertips! Introducing our *
*C++ Math Library**, a treasure trove of mathematical marvels! 🎉

🔢 **Arithmetic at its finest!** Our [aritmetics.ixx](includes/aritmetics.ixx) offers full type support for vectors,
including integer, unsigned integer, and floating-point types in 2, 3, and 4 dimensions.

🌀 **Bend and shape with Bézier curves!** Our [bezier.ixx](includes/bezier.ixx) provides Quadratic Bézier curves for
integers, unsigned integers, and floats in 2, 3, and 4 dimensions.

🔢 We've got **constants** galore! Pi, e, phi, and more! They're all here, ready and waiting in
our [constants.hpp](includes/constants.ixx)!

🔐 Hashing, hashing, and more hashing! We've got a smorgasbord of **hashing functions** for all your hashing needs! Dive
into our [hashing.hpp](includes/hashing.ixx)!

🔄 Need to interpolate? We've got you covered with functions like **lerp**, **ease in**, **ease out**, and **map**! Check
them out in our [interpolation.hpp](includes/interpolation.ixx)!

🎲 Feeling lucky? Try our **random number generator**! It's lightning fast, thanks to its use of a permutation table!
Take a peek at our [random.hpp](includes/random.hpp)!

📊 Crunch those numbers with our **basic statistics**! Get the mean, median, and more out of an array! It's all in
our [statistics.hpp](includes/statistics.hpp)!

📐 And let's not forget about **trigonometry**! We've got some trigonometric functions just for you in
our [trigonometric.hpp](includes/trigonometric.hpp)!

💡 And for those who aren't fans of the long double, we've got the **Dekker Double**! (Note: It does not work with other
functions.) You can find it in our [dekkerdouble.hpp](includes/dekkerdouble.hpp)!

So what are you waiting for? Dive into the world of mathematics with our C++ Math Library today! 🎈
