🚀 **Step right up, step right up!** Welcome to the future of mathematics, right at your fingertips! Introducing our *
*C++ Math Library**, a treasure trove of mathematical marvels! 🎉

🔢 We've got **constants** galore! Pi, e, phi, and more! They're all here, ready and waiting in
our [constants.hpp](includes/constants.hpp)!

🔄 Need to interpolate? We've got you covered with functions like **lerp**, **ease in**, **ease out**, and **map**! Check
them out in our [interpolation.hpp](includes/interpolation.hpp)!

🔐 Hashing, hashing, and more hashing! We've got a smorgasbord of **hashing functions** for all your hashing needs! Dive
into our [hashing.hpp](includes/hashing.hpp)!

🎲 Feeling lucky? Try our **random number generator**! It's lightning fast, thanks to its use of a permutation table!
Take a peek at our [random.hpp](includes/random.hpp)!

📊 Crunch those numbers with our **basic statistics**! Get the mean, median, and more out of an array! It's all in
our [statistics.hpp](includes/statistics.hpp)!

📐 And let's not forget about **trigonometry**! We've got some trigonometric functions just for you in
our [trigonometric.hpp](includes/trigonometric.hpp)!

💡 And for those who aren't fans of the long double, we've got the **Dekker Double**! (Note: It does not work with other
functions.) You can find it in our [dekkerdouble.hpp](includes/dekkerdouble.hpp)!

**NOTE:** There are plenty of libraries out there that handle Vectors and matrices (like OpenGL Math). That's why this
math library focuses on other algebraic functions and objects. We're here to fill in the gaps and take your mathematical
capabilities to the next level!

So what are you waiting for? Dive into the world of mathematics with our C++ Math Library today! 🎈
